The HTML <script> tag is used to define a client-side script (JavaScript).

The <script> element either contains script statements, or it points to an external script file through the src attribute.

Common uses for JavaScript are image manipulation, form validation, and dynamic changes of content.
HTML defines the structure of your content, CSS determines the style and layout, and JavaScript makes the content interactive; 
therefore, it makes the most sense to learn them in that order. JavaScript incorporates valuable skills such as object-oriented, 
functional, and imperative styles of programming
